            <h1 class="md-display-1">What is AtomicBase?</h1>

            <p>AtomicBase is a lightweight Firebase Framework  built in ECMA5.</p>

            <h1 class="md-display-1">Why AtomicBase?</h1>

            <p>When working on applications that can potentially reach a large scale we know we
                can always count on NoSQL Structures and amazing SPA frameworks.</p>

            <h1 class="md-title">But, why do we keep facing the same challenges over and over?</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>Data Consistency - Multilocation Actions (Updates/Deletes)</li>
                <li>Schemaless Structures</li>
                <li>Custom handling of data while building an object in order to perform a Database action</li>
                <li>Correct approach to handle all Refs within an application</li>
                <li>High performance pagination capabilities with smart/planned event
                    listeners in order to maintain the array synced with the Database.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="md-display-1">This is where AtomicBase comes in</h1>

            <strong>AtomicBase is in an experimental stage and it
                is not recommended for production unless you know your way around ECMA5 and the latest Firebase SDK.</strong>
